    "### Comparing Programming Language Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Data Types Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding data types is **crucial for writing efficient, bug-free programs**, regardless of the language being used.\n",
    "\n",
    "In various language paradigms, data types serve distinct critical roles:\n",
    "*   **Statically Typed Languages** (e.g., C++, Java): Data types assist in catching errors before the code runs and facilitate optimizations during compile time.\n",
    "*   **Dynamically Typed Languages** (e.g., Python, JavaScript): While offering flexibility, they necessitate careful management to avoid type mismatch errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, data types determine how much memory variables consume, how they are stored, and what specific operations can be executed on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Core Data Type Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "The table below outlines the core data types across four popular programming languages, drawing from the source comparison chart:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Type Category | C++ | Java | Python | JavaScript |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **Numeric Types** | `short`, `int`, `long`, `long long`, `float`, `double`, `long double` (+ unsigned modifiers) | `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `double` | `int` (arbitrary precision), `float`, `complex` | `number` (IEEE-754 standard), `bigint` |\n",
    "| **Text / Char** | `char`, `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`, `std::string` | `char` (UTF-16 encoding), `String` | `str` | `string` |\n",
    "| **Boolean** | `bool` | `boolean` | `bool` | `boolean` |\n",
    "| **Collections (Core)** | `std::vector`, `std::array`, `std::list`, `std::deque`, `std::set`, `std::map`, `std::unordered_map` | `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `HashSet`, `HashMap`, `TreeMap`, arrays | `list`, `tuple`, `dict`, `set`, `frozenset`, `range` | `Array`, plain objects (`{}`), `Map`, `Set`, `WeakMap`, `WeakSet`, `TypedArray` |\n",
    "| **Special / Null** | `nullptr` | `null` | `None` | `null`, `undefined`, `NaN` |\n",
    "| **User-Defined Types** | `struct`, `class`, `enum`, `union`, `templates` | `Classes`, `interfaces`, `enums`, `records` | `Classes` (everything is an object), `dataclasses`, `enums`, `typing hints` | `Objects`, `classes` (syntax over prototypes), `symbols` |\n",
    "| **Notes on Language Implementation** | Static typing is used; sizes of types depend on the platform; RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) and value semantics are frequent. | Static typing is used; key distinction between primitives vs. wrappers (`int` vs `Integer`); `String` is immutable. | Dynamic typing is used; the distinction between immutable (`tuple`) vs. mutable (`list`) collections is important; **integers are unbounded**. | Dynamic typing is used; characterized by type coercion; a known quirk is that `typeof null` returns `\"object\"`; numbers default to double-precision. |"

    "## 8. Time and Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Time complexity is a concept used to **judge different codes** and helps determine which code is better, often used by interviewers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definition and Measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Definition**: Time complexity is the **rate at which the time, required to run a code, changes with respect to the input size**.\n",
    "*   **Independence**: It depends on the input size, **not on the machine used** to run the code. This is because the execution time varies greatly based on machine configuration (e.g., low-end vs. high-end).\n",
    "*   **Representation**: Time complexity is generally represented using the **Big O notation** (e.g., $O(N)$, $O(N^2)$).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rules for Calculating Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "When calculating time complexity, three main rules are followed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Calculate for the Worst-Case Scenario**: This case refers to when the code takes the **maximum amount of time** (or steps) to execute. Calculating the worst case helps judge the robustness of the code.\n",
    "2.  **Avoid including Constant Terms**: Constant terms (like $+8$ in $O(4N^3 + 3N^2 + 8)$) are often insignificant when the input size ($N$) is large and should be avoided (e.g., $O(3N+1)$ becomes $O(3N)$).\n",
    "3.  **Avoid the Lower Values**: When $N$ is large, lower degree terms (like $3N^2$ compared to $4N^3$) become less significant and should be ignored (e.g., $O(4N^3 + 3N^2)$ becomes $O(4N^3)$).\n",
    "    *   *Note*: The constant coefficients (like $4$ in $O(4N^3)$) can also be ignored, resulting in $O(N^3)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Space complexity refers to the **memory space that a code uses while being executed**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definition and Measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Definition**: Space complexity represents the **summation of auxiliary space and the input space**.\n",
    "    *   **Auxiliary space** refers to the additional space used to solve a problem.\n",
    "    *   **Input space** refers to the space used to store the inputs.\n",
    "*   **Representation**: Space complexity is also represented using **Big O notation** (instead of standard units like MB or GB) because it is machine-dependent.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Good Coding Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "*   It is crucial **not to manipulate the given inputs or data** (even if doing so reduces space complexity).\n",
    "*   This rule exists because a company may use the same data for different purposes. Manipulation should only occur if the interviewer specifically instructs it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Points to Remember\n",
    "\n",
    "*   In competitive programming or in the platforms like Leetcode and GeeksforGeeks, we generally run our codes on online servers. \n",
    "*   Most of these servers execute roughly 108 operations in approximately 1 second i.e. 1s. \n",
    "*   We must be careful that if the time limit is given as 2s the operations in our code must be roughly 2*108, not 1016. Similarly, 5s refers to 5*108. \n",
    "*   Simply, if we want our code to be run in 1s, the time complexity of our code must be around O(108) avoiding the constants and the lower values.\n",
