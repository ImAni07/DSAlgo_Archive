    "## Hashing Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashing is a crucial technique utilized in data structures. Its primary purpose is to **store and retrieve data effectively**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashing enables core Data Structure operations—such as **insertion, searching, and deletion**—to be performed highly efficiently. These operations typically achieve a **constant time complexity, $O(1)$, on average**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components of Hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of hashing fundamentally relies on two stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Hash Code Generation:** This involves converting the input data (which might be a string, character, or number) into a numerical hash code (an integer). For simple integer data, the number itself can be the hash code. For strings, techniques like converting characters to their ASCII values and summing or processing them are used.\n",
    "2.  **Compression Function (Mapping Function):** This function takes the hash code and maps it to a valid index or location within the hash table. The goal is to determine the correct position to store the data. The simplest mapping function is the **Division Method**, using the modulo operator (e.g., $k \\pmod{M}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "The storage structure where data is mapped and stored is often referred to as a **Hash Table** or **Hash Array**."

    "## Time Complexity: Brute Force vs. Hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the efficiency gained by hashing, we compare it against the brute force method for frequency counting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Brute Force Approach (Linear Iteration)\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an array and $Q$ queries, the brute force approach involves iterating through the entire array for every query to count occurrences.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an array of size $N$, the time complexity for a single search operation is $O(N)$. If there are $Q$ queries, the total time complexity is $O(Q \\cdot N)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example of Performance Limitation:**\n",
    "If $Q = 10^5$ and $N = 10^5$, the total operations amount to $10^{10}$. Since $10^8$ operations take approximately 1 second, $10^{10}$ operations take around **100 seconds**. This execution time is unacceptable for efficient programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Optimized Approach using Hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashing optimizes this by using a combination of **pre-storing and fetching**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Pre-storing:** Calculating and storing the frequency of all elements in the array (or string) beforehand.\n",
    "2.  **Fetching:** Retrieving the stored frequency directly using the element as an index or key, ideally taking $O(1)$ time."

    "### 1. Number Hashing using Arrays (For Small Ranges)\n",
    "\n",
    "When the maximum value in the input array is known and small (e.g., max value is 12), we can use a fixed-size array (Hash Array) where the index represents the number, and the stored value represents its frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraint Alert:** Array hashing is limited by the maximum size array that can be declared. For integer types, the maximum size is typically $10^6$ inside the main function or $10^7$ globally."

    "## Hash Collision and Resolution Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Collision?\n",
    "\n",
    "A hash collision occurs when two different pieces of data (keys) produce the **same hash index** when processed by the hash function. When this happens, both keys attempt to occupy the same location in the hash table, leading to a conflict.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Division Method and Chaining\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Division Method** is a technique used to hash keys, especially when limited hash space is available. It uses the modulo operator to reduce a large number ($k$) to a smaller index within the hash table size ($M$):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{Index} = k \\pmod{M} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If multiple elements yield the same remainder, a collision occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Collision Resolution: Separate Chaining\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle collisions using the Division Method, **Separate Chaining** (or Linear Chaining) is often employed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this method, instead of storing just a count or a single element at an index, a **chain (usually implemented as a Linked List)** is created at that index (bucket). If a collision occurs, the new element is added to the chain at that index.\n",
    "\n",
    "**C++ Unordered Map Implementation:** The C++ `unordered_map` internally uses the concept of hashing, often implemented via **Separate Chaining**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Load Factor and Resizing\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Load Factor** is a crucial metric for maintaining the $O(1)$ average time complexity in hash tables using chaining.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{Load Factor} = \\frac{\\text{Total Number of Elements}}{\\text{Size of Hash Table}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the load factor exceeds a defined maximum limit (e.g., 5, used for illustration in the source), the hash table's size is **doubled**, and all existing elements are **re-distributed (re-hashed)** into the new, larger table. This ensures that chains do not become too long, preventing the worst-case time complexity of $O(N)$."

    "### Open Addressing Techniques (Alternative Collision Resolution)\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of chaining, **Open Addressing** (Probing) involves finding the next available slot in the hash table when a collision occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Linear Probing:** If a slot $k$ is occupied, the algorithm checks the next sequential slot, $k+1$, then $k+2$, and so on.\n",
    "    *   **Problem:** Leads to **Primary Clustering** where data concentrates together in long sequences, making insertions and searches slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Quadratic Probing:** The distance between probes is calculated using an increasing quadratic sequence ($k + i^2$). This helps spread the data better than linear probing, addressing Primary Clustering.\n",
    "    *   **Problem:** Leads to **Secondary Clustering** when keys that initially map to the same location follow the same probing sequence, although the data is less concentrated.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Double Hashing:** Uses two independent hash functions, $h_1(k)$ and $h_2(k)$, to determine the jump size when collisions occur. The probe sequence is defined as $h(k, i) = (h_1(k) + i \\cdot h_2(k)) \\pmod{M}$.\n",
    "    *   **Advantage:** Resolves the Secondary Clustering issue.\n",
    "    *   **Disadvantage:** Requires higher computational time (hashing twice) and complexity in designing good hash functions.\n",

    "## Cryptographic Hashing (Advanced Concepts)\n",
    "\n",
    "Cryptographic hashing is distinct from data structure hashing and is primarily used in real-world applications for security, such as maintaining **message integrity** and **password storage**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Message Integrity (Detecting Tampering)\n",
    "\n",
    "Cryptographic hash functions (like SHA-256) generate a fixed-length hash code (e.g., 256 bits) regardless of the size of the input message. This hash code is sent alongside the original message.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the message is tampered with (even a change of one bit or character), the hash code generated from the received message will be drastically different from the original hash code, allowing the recipient to detect the change.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties of Cryptographic Hash Codes\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Avalanche Effect:** A tiny change in the input (e.g., changing 't' to 'T') results in a complete change in the generated hash code. This prevents attackers from finding patterns.\n",
    "2.  **Irreversibility (One-Way Function):** It is mathematically impossible to reverse the process and derive the original message or data from the 256-bit hash code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Password Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "Companies **never store passwords** (e.g., \"Ani\") in their databases. Instead, they store the **hash code** corresponding to the password.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user attempts to log in, the input password is first converted to its hash code, and this generated code is compared against the stored hash code in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent sophisticated attacks (like using pre-computed common password hashes), a technique called **Salting** is used. Salting involves adding random, company-defined characters to the user's password *before* generating the hash code, making it unique and unpredictable to attackers."
